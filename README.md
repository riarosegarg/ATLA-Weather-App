*Please don't do anything with my API Key, I'm trying to figure out how to hide it lolüôè*

This is an Avatar the Last Air Bender Weather App where different characters represent different conditions in the sky. 

Aang: mist, fog, haze

Katara: rain

Iroh: clouds

Yue: snow

Zuko: clear

Azula: thunderstorm 

Toph: dust, smoke, etc. 

I used a YouTube tutorial to first understand the code behind connnecting a weather API to code. I followed the tutorial, then created my own project
where I changed and added many elements to personalize my app.

I also used Chat GPT for any issues I encountered while debugging, as I am not too familiar with JS/CSS/HTML. 

All the images are hand-drawn by me through Procreate (excluding the wind and humidity symbols. Image credit for these: https://www.freepik.com/)
